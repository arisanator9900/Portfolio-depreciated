            HI, Iâ€™m Alex! I have always been interested in coding, and have been tinkering around computers since I was 13 years old. 
            <br><br>
            As a Front End Developer I never stop learning new things, building new projects and expanding my skills. 
            <br><br>
            I dove into Html, CSS, Javascript, UI and Graphic design during my degree at the University of Maryland
            <br><br>
            Now I've graduated and will continue to learn and challenge myself! I can't wait to dive into your project! 
        </p>
